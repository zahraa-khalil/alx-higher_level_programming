0x06. Python - Classes and Objects


Classes


Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as fields. 
Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. Such functions are called methods of the class.
Collectively, the fields and methods can be referred to as the attributes of that class.

Fields are of two types - they can belong to each instance/object of the class or they can belong to the class itself. They are called instance variables and class variables respectively.


The self:
class called MyClass - instance of this class called myobject
myobject.method(arg1, arg2) == MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2)
